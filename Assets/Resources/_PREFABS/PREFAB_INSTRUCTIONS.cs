    // After dragging and dropping into scene variables ground and gamemanager have to be assigned
    // Ground needs the grid object containing all tile maps
    // GameManager needs the game manager object
    // To change the direction the mirror is facing the 'angle' variable needs to be changed 
    // 0 = Down; 1 = Right; 2 = Up; 3 = Left;
    // To let the Mirror rotate automatically the 'Timed' Checkbox needs to be checked and a time for how long each rotation should take needs to be put into 'Timer' (in seconds)
